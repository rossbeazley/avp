next steps: 23/12/13
implement a screen with a button and text box.
text box is prepopulated with the video url but can be overwritten
when the button is pressed the "User wants to load a video at url" event is dispatched
attached to the event is the value from the text box as a payload

The navigation controller will have to be changed,
the default navigation now is to show this new screen
the video player screen should be shown in response to the user load event
