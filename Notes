There is a factory that creates a MediaPlayer

There is an object that prepares a media player, when prepared it lets the system know

There is an object that takes a prepared media player and wires up the view -- this is droid code
 - I can ask the media player if its audio and create a differnt view

There is an object that takes a prepared media player and auto starts it


Things to consider:
the idea of multiple adapters for one media player object, what would that look like?
The "factory" could actually keep a reference to the mediaplayer and can make multiple adapters
when prepared it could create a control adapter and announce it to the world - handles play, pause etc
sounds a bit like a singleton
