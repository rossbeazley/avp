Kata Rules:
One activity, it just does NEW
Event bus (ie message orientated programming)
No mocking frameworks
Find a use for dependency injection eg in your fragments



Messages:

User wants to load a video at a url

User wants to pause
User wants to play (un pause)
User wants to seek to a position

Media is ready to play (loaded)
Media has started playing
Media has started paused
Media playback position (time) has changed
Media has finished

User leaves the app
User returns to the app
User exits the app
User wants to restart the media



Objects:

User
Media player
Rule - auto start media on load



next steps: 23/12/13
implement a screen with a button and text box.
text box is prepopulated with the video url but can be overwritten
when the button is pressed the "User wants to load a video at url" event is dispatched
attached to the event is the value from the text box as a payload

The navigation controller will have to be changed,
the default navigation now is to show this new screen
the video player screen should be shown in response to the user load event


Wiring up the domain:

need to be authenticated
user service, can "authenticate" to and get a user back


A programme
programme repository, can search, is it a user search? ie need a user object and search criteria


A programme stream, retrievable from programme repo?





MID REFACTOR:
going to pull presenters, navigation controllers and screen interfaces into CORE project.
need to wrap the dependencies service with a test to check its assembled correctly, consider an intergrated test to replace the current injection tests
need to pull the navigation controllers factory out into its own object
